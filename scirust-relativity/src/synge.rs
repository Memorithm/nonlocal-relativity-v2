//! Synge's world function and its first-derivative bitensors.
//!
//! Synge's world function `sigma(x', x)` is the biscalar equal to one-half the
//! signed squared geodesic distance between a base point `x'` and a field point
//! `x`: it is negative for timelike separation, positive for spacelike, and zero
//! for null (under the `(-,+,+,+)` convention). With the unique geodesic linking
//! the two points parametrized affinely on `[0, 1]`,
//!
//! ```text
//! sigma(x', x) = (1/2) g_{mu nu}(x') v^mu v^nu,   v = log_{x'}(x),
//! ```
//!
//! where `v` is the tangent at `x'` of that geodesic — exactly the geodesic
//! logarithm map ([`crate::geodesic_logarithm`]). Because `g(v, v)` is conserved
//! along an affine geodesic, evaluating it at `x'` gives the whole world
//! function; no separate distance integral is needed.
//!
//! Its first covariant derivatives are bitensors (each transforms as a vector at
//! one of the two points):
//!
//! - at the base point, `sigma^{mu'} = -v` (minus the tangent at `x'`);
//! - at the field point, `sigma^{mu} = -log_x(x')` (the tangent at `x` of the
//!   geodesic from `x'` to `x`, directed away from `x'`).
//!
//! Both obey the fundamental identity `2 sigma = g_{mu nu} sigma^mu sigma^nu`
//! (contracted with the metric at the respective point). The base-point identity
//! holds by construction; the field-point identity, evaluated with an
//! independent logarithm shooting from `x`, is a genuine convention-free check
//! that the two ends agree on the same geodesic distance — as is the symmetry
//! `sigma(x', x) = sigma(x, x')`.
//!
//! In flat spacetime everything is exact: `sigma = (1/2) eta_{mu nu} Δ^mu Δ^nu`
//! with `Δ = x - x'`, `sigma^{mu'} = -Δ`, and `sigma^mu = Δ`. This is established
//! general relativity, built entirely on the existing geodesic exponential /
//! logarithm maps; no new geodesic solver is introduced.
